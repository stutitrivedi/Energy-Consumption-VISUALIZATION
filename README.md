Household Electricity Consumption â€” Energy Pattern Analysis
Energy consumption is not only about total usage but about when, where, and how it is used. This project analyzes minute-level electricity usage from a real household in France and visualizes hidden patterns in daily life energy behavior.

My contributions:

Parsed and cleaned 2 million+ rows of timestamped electricity data using pandas.

Visualized trends in active power, voltage, and sub-metered usage for kitchen, laundry, and heating systems.

Created interactive time series charts that allow viewers to hover and explore exact usage moments.

Generated a weekday-vs-hour heatmap to reveal peak and off-peak usage periods.

Created a correlation matrix to understand relationships between electrical parameters (e.g., voltage vs. intensity).

Summarized usage in daily averages and weekly trends for simpler communication.
